cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or
neglected, it must, and will, <em>bring forth.</em> If no useful seeds are
<em>put</em> into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will <em>fall</em>
therein, and will continue to produce their kind.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds,
and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man
tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and
