<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">destiny.</p><p>As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his own
thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and contains within
himself that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may
make himself what he wills.</p><p>Man is always the master, even in his weaker and most abandoned
state; but in his weakness and degradation he is the foolish master
who misgoverns his "household." When he begins to reflect upon his
condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being
is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his
energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful
issues. Such is the <em>conscious</em> master, and man can only thus become
by discovering <em>within himself</em> the laws of thought; which discovery
is totally a matter of application, self analysis, and experience.</p></div> </div>
