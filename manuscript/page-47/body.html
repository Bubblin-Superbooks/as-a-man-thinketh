them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step.</p><p>He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure. His
every thought is allied with power, and all difficulties are
bravely met and wisely overcome. His purposes are seasonably
planted, and they bloom and bring forth fruit, which does not fall
prematurely to the ground.</p><p>Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force: he who
<em>knows</em> this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a
mere bundle of wavering thoughts and fluctuating sensations; he who
<em>does</em> this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his
mental powers.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
