<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">future power and triumph.</p><p>Those who are not prepared for the apprehension of a <em>great</em> purpose
should fix the thoughts upon the faultless performance of their
duty, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. Only in
this way can the thoughts be gathered and focussed, and resolution
and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which
may not be accomplished.</p><p>The weakest soul, knowing its own weakness, and believing this truth
<em>that strength can only be developed by effort and practice,</em> will,
thus believing, at once begin to exert itself, and, adding effort to
effort, patience to patience, and strength to strength, will never
cease to develop, and will at last grow divinely strong.</p><p>As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and
patient training, so the man of weak thoughts can make them strong
by exercising himself in right thinking.</p></div> </div>
