of the body; there is no comforter to compare with goodwill for
dispersing the shadows of grief and sorrow. To live continually in
thoughts of ill will, cynicism, suspicion, and envy, is to be
confined in a self made prison-hole. But to think well of all, to be
cheerful with all, to patiently learn to find the good in allâ€”such

by day in thoughts of peace toward every creature will bring
abounding peace to their possessor.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
